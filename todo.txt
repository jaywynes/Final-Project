This is basically just a list of what we need to do for the program

Betting system, such as chip value, ante system, etc

Action system: check, bet, call, raise, fold, etc

Hand evaluation: Testing to see what everyones hands are
to determine winner

Perhaps later stuff:

Hand percentages, showing your outs/ other peoples outs, etc
